                      Subtitle Editor 6.0c Classic
                      ============================

Subtitle Editor derived from version 6.0b, but with UTF-8, audio stream selection etc.

More detailed:

    UTF8 and UTF16 subtitles supported now
        Adapted also the "Insert Symbol" screen.
        UTF8 format is detected automatically.
        The "Save as" screen has been adapted to add the possibility to save a subtitle as UTF8.
		
    Detection and selection of more than one audio stream is implemented.	
	
    Made a number of screens re-size-able:
        The "Settings" screen
        The "Output settings" screen and
        The "Error and Info" Settings screen.
        The sizes and positions are saved.
		
    The List fontsize is now separated from the Program FontSize
        The separated List font size has been added to the settings menu
		
    The main menu is made more readable with bigger Program fontsizes.
        also most screens have been re-arranged for this purpose
        in some cases the re-size method has been adapted
		
    All screens are made bigger to better cope with high resolution monitors.
	
    "Setdelay" now shows the time difference between a (stopped) movie time and a selected subtitle time, 
        which is more convenient.
		
    The file size reported by "Movie Information" is correct now also for files > 4 Gb.
	
    Added the "m4v" movie format as a valid one.
	
    Removed a few situations where errors could occur (e.g. doubleclicking on an empty errors list).
	
    Make spellcheck work again with Word 2016.
    
    Corrected an error reading a.o. 'SAMI' subtitles.
