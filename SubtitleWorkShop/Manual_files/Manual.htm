<h3>1.2 Reading &amp; Writing engine</h3>Subtitle Workshop's reading &amp; 
writing engine has highly evolved since the beginning, and was rewritten from 
scratch a bunch of times. Many people have gladly reported bugs and they were 
all fixed as soon as we could. As time passed, the engine became more reliable 
and stable. Because of this reliability is that we decided to release <b>URUSoft 
Subtitle API</b>. <br><br><br><a name="1.2.1"></a>
<h5>1.2.1 What is URUSoft Subtitle API?</h5>It is simply a dynamic link library 
(DLL) which contains the Subtitle Workshop reading and writing engine. This DLL 
was created so updates in the reading engine of Subtitle Workshop can be 
published without releasing a new version, that not only includes bug fixes, but 
also new subtitle formats. Because of this DLL, you only have to download few kb 
instead of more than 800 kb if you find a bug in the reading or writing 
engine.<br>After downloading the DLL, you must go to Subtitle Workshop's folder 
and put it in the "SubtitleAPI" directory. The next time you open Subtitle 
Workshop, new formats/bug fixes will make effect. <br><br><br><a name="1.3"></a>
<h3>1.3 Visual overview</h3>If we are going to have a visual overview, we should 
start by looking at a screenshots. To view some, click <a href="http://www.urusoft.net/products.php?cat=sw&amp;lang=1">here</a>. 
<br><br>One of the things that make Subtitle Workshop unique is it's interface - 
very user friendly but at the same time keeps the basic and advanced 
functionality in easy to access menus.<br>The interface is ideal for virtually 
*any* task - you can obtain an excellent performance creating subtitles, fixing 
times manually, translating subtitles, and of course, using all the built in 
features. <br><br><br><a name="1.4"></a>
<h3>1.4 Getting started</h3>Get started using Subtitle Workshop's basic 
features. <br><a name="1.4.1"></a>
<h5>1.4.1 Loading a subtitle file</h5>To load a subtitle file simply click the 
<b>"File/Load Subtitle"</b> menu or press <b>[Ctrl]+[O]</b> keys. Additionally, 
you can drop your file into the main window, or if the extensions are 
associated, just double click on the subtitle file you wish to open. 
<br><br>Every time you load a file using any of this methods, the file will be 
checked to see if it is a valid file and which is the format of it. Most of the 
files will load properly, but if you get the "The file is a bad subtitle or an 
unsupported format" error message, there is still some chance you can load the 
file. First of all you <b>MUST</b> be sure about the format of the file, if you 
are, then proceed like this: 
<ol>
  <li>Click the <b>"File/Load subtitle"</b> menu. 
  </li><li>A dialog will pop up, you have to select the right filter in it (there is 
  a combo box where you see the "All supported files" text, you have to click 
  the button with the arrow that is next to it and select the format of the 
  file). 
  </li><li>Once you have done this, press the <b>Open</b> button in the dialog. 
</li></ol>This way there will be no automatic format recognition nor file check. 
If the file still can't be loaded, you will get an error message. In this case, 
if you are sure the file is a text-based subtitle format <a href="http://www.urusoft.net/contactus.php?lang=1">e-mail it to me</a> and I'll 
fix it. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.2"></a>
<h5>1.4.2 Loading a video file</h5>To load a video file simply click the 
<b>"Movie/Open"</b> menu or press the <b>[Ctrl]+[P]</b> keys. If you get the 
"File is not a valid video file" error message, make sure you have the right 
codecs installed. If you don't, download <a href="http://jdoe.host.sk/">Coda 
Codec Pack</a>, it should fix most of the playback problems. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.3"></a>
<h5>1.4.3 Create a new file</h5>Using Subtitle Workshop you can easily create 
new files from scratch, and then save them in any format. To do so, click the 
<b>"File/New subtitle..."</b> menu or press <b>[Ctrl]+[N]</b> keys. Once you 
have done this, you can start adding subtitles, and then save the file by the 
<b>"File/Save"</b> menu or pressing <b>[Ctrl]+[S]</b> keys. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.4"></a>
<h5>1.4.4 Adding subtitles</h5>You just need to press the <b>Insert</b> key or 
click the <b>"Edit/Insert subtitle"</b> menu. The subtitle will always be added 
right after the focused item. The default duration of the new subtitle is one 
second, and the start time of it is always going to be the final time of the 
previous one plus 1 millisecond. If you are adding the subtitle in a blank list, 
the initial time of it will be zero.<br><br>If you want to insert a subtitle 
before the selected item, press <b>[Shift]+[Insert]</b> keys or the 
<b>"Edit/Insert before"</b> menu. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.5"></a>
<h5>1.4.5 Deleting subtitles</h5>Select all the subtitles you wish to delete by 
holding Ctrl key and click in them and press the <b>Delete</b> key or click the 
<b>"Edit/Remove selected"</b> menu. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.6"></a>
<h5>1.4.6 Manually edit a subtitle</h5>Every subtitle is composed by three 
parts: 
<ol>
  <li>The <b>initial time</b> - the time in which the subtitle is shown. 
  </li><li>The <b>final time</b> - the time in which the subtitle is hidden. 
  </li><li>The <b>text</b> - the subtitle itself. </li></ol>Subtitle Workshop lets you 
easily edit any of these fields.<br><br>To edit the initial time just click the 
<b>"Show"</b> field, set the time (or frames) you wish and press 
<b>[Enter]</b>.<br>To edit the final time click the <b>"Hide"</b> field, set the 
time (or frames) you wish and press <b>[Enter]</b>. Note that you can also edit 
the final time of a subtitle by changing the <b>"Duration"</b> 
field.<br>Additionally, you can edit any of this time values using the Up-Down 
buttons at the right side of each text box.<br><br>To edit the text, simply 
click the "Text" box and write the desired text. In the list of subtitles, the 
character <b>"|"</b> (pipe) represents new line. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.7"></a>
<h5>1.4.7 Style and color tags</h5>First of all, you must know that Subtitle 
Workshop <b>only</b> supports tags for <b>the whole subtitle</b>. So if you 
really want to apply font style over one part of the subtitle, you are going to 
need notepad. As it only supports tags for the whole subtitle, you only need to 
open the tags because closing them would be useless. The supported tags are: 
<ul>
  <li><b>&lt;b&gt;</b> for <b>bold</b> 
  </li><li><b>&lt;i&gt;</b> for <i>italic</i> 
  </li><li><b>&lt;u&gt;</b> for <u>underline</u> 
  </li><li><b>&lt;c:#<font color="#ff0000">RR</font><font color="#00ff00">GG</font><font color="#0000ff">BB</font>&gt;</b> for color, the format of the color is HTML 
  format </li></ul>To add this tags you can simply write them, and additionally 
you can right-click the list of subtitles and a menu will pop up, you can use 
this menu to control the all tags on the selected subtitles. Note that more than 
one tag can be used in the same subtitle (of course, if they are all different 
tags), it may have even the 4 supported tags at the same time. 
<br><br><b>WARNING:</b> Please note that not all subtitle formats support style 
tags, nor color tags. If you save these tags in a subtitle format which doesn't 
support them, the tags will be lost. <br><br><br><a name="1.4.8"></a>
<h5>1.4.8 FPS and Input FPS</h5>Knowing the difference between this two fields 
is crucial to work with Subtitle Workshop. <br><br><b>Input FPS </b>is the FPS 
of the movie that the subtitle was originally made for. <b>FPS</b> is the FPS of 
the movie you want it to adjust the subtitle to. You have to modify this field 
in order to convert FPS. When editing frame based subtitles there is no need for 
Input FPS (we only need FPS) so "Input FPS" will become absolutely useless after 
loading frame based subtitles (it won't have any effect in the times). 
<br><br><b>Q:</b> How do I convert a 25 FPS subtitle File into 
29,97?<br><b>A:</b> Simply set "Input FPS" to 25, load the subtitle file and 
then set "FPS" to 29,97. You have just changed framerate of the file. 
<br><br><br><a name="1.5"></a>
<h3>1.5 Command line parameters</h3>It is highly recommended that you send each 
parameter to Subtitle Workshop between " " to avoid problems with spaces in the 
name/path of the files.<br><br><b>To open a file:<br>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/OPEN(File)"</b> <br><br>Example:<br><i>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/OPEN(C:\Subtitle.srt)"</i> <br><br><b>To convert from one format to 
another:<br>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/CONVERT(Input_File/Output_File/Output_Format/Input_FPS/Output_FPS)" 
</b><br><br>Input FPS and Output FPS are only required if you are handling frame 
based files, if not, you may specify any value. In the FPS, if not a rounded 
value, the decimal digits have to be separated using the decimal separator 
(configurable from Control panel/Regional and language settings) of the PC on 
which Subtitle Workshop is running. Usually it is "," or ".". The subtitle 
format has to be in the form of a string, and if you are using an updated 
version of SubtitleAPI you may specify new formats, since the possible formats 
depends on the version of SubtitleAPI.<br><br>For you to know all the supported 
formats and <b>*exactly*</b> how you should write them, call Subtitle Workshop 
like this:<br><br><b>SubtitleWorkshop.exe /GetSupportedFormats</b><br><br>After 
doing this Subtitle Workshop will save a list of the supported formats to the 
path in which it is installed, in a TXT file with the name 
"SupportedFormats.txt". <br><br>Some examples:<br><i>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/CONVERT(C:\Folder\Sub.smi/C:\Subtitle.pjs/Phoenix Japanimation 
Society/25/29,97)"<br>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/CONVERT(C:\Subtitle.vsf/C:\Subtitle.jss/JACOSub 
2.7+/23,976/0)"<br>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/CONVERT(C:\Subtitle.srt/C:\Subtitle.sub/MicroDVD/29,97/29,97)"<br></i><br><b>To 
delay a file:<br>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/DELAY(Input_File/Output_File/Input_FPS/Delay_in_Milliseconds)" 
</b><br><br>Example:<br><i>SubtitleWorkshop.exe 
"/DELAY(C:\Subtitle.srt/C:\Subtitle.srt/0/-5000)"</i><br><br>The example above 
will set a -5 seconds delay to Subtitle.srt and overwrite it. We specify 0 as 
FPS since we are loading a time based format. As in the parameter to convert a 
file, if FPS is not a rounded value, the decimal digits have to be separated 
using the decimal separator of the PC in which Subtitle Workshop is running. If 
you specify a wrong FPS and FPS is really needed, then the default FPS (25) will 
be used. <br><br><br><a name="1.6"></a>
<h3>1.6 Language files</h3>You can easily create your own language file or 
update a currently existing language file and use it in Subtitle Workshop. To do 
so, you must translate the English.lng (or any other .lng) file to the language 
you want, and then copy it to the Langs directory with the name language.lng. 
For example, Español.lng, English.lng, Français.lng.<br><br><b>Warning! </b>Do 
<b>*NOT*</b> translate the text between "[ ]" and the text after the % sign (for 
example "%s" or "%d"). Otherwise the language file will not work properly!. 
<br><br><b>Tips:</b> 
<ul>
  <li>If the language you are translating to use another charset than 
  ANSI_CHARSET do not forget to change it on the [General] section. Read 
  charsets.txt for a reference. 
  </li><li>In the messages, character "|" (pipe) represents new line. </li></ul>After 
you create a language file, <a href="http://www.urusoft.net/contactus.php?lang=1">send it to me</a> so I can 
distribute it with the installation package. The name of the translator will be 
shown in the About Subtitle Workshop window. <br><br><br><a name="1.7"></a>
<h3>1.7 Custom formats</h3>This feature makes possible to save a subtitle file 
in a format that Subtitle Workshop doesn't support, or to easily create your own 
format or text files with subtitles. This option is only to save files, if you 
do this in a format that Subtitle Workshop doesn't support, reading the file 
will not be possible.<br><br>To access the custom formats dialogue first load a 
subtitle, then click the <b>"File/Save as..." </b>menu and then click the 
<b>"Custom format"</b> button.<br><br><b>Format name</b><br>This is useful to 
identify the format in which you are saving the file (or the project). 
<br><br><b>Extension</b> Specifies the file extension of the format. Subtitle 
Workshop will use this when saving the file. Please note that the format of the 
extension must be "*.CHARS". <br><br><b>Structure</b><br>Specifies the time 
structure. <b>h</b> represents hours, <b>m</b> minutes, <b>s</b> seconds and 
<b>z</b> milliseconds. If you write more than one h or "m" or "s" or "z", all 
the h or "m" or "s" or "z" have to be together. You can't write something like 
"h:m:h:,zmzs". A time like "00:00:00,0" would be "hh:mm:ss,z" and a time like 
"0:00:00,000" would be "h:mm:ss,zzz". If you want the time structure to be just 
milliseconds, write "MS" instead of a time structure. <br><br><b>Time or 
frames</b><br>Check the "Time" field if you are going to work with time. If you 
are going to work with frames, then check the "frames" field and you don't need 
to specify a structure, because frames are always going to be a simple number. 
<br><br><b>FPS</b><br>Select the FPS of the subtitle you are saving. If you are 
saving a time subtitle to another time subtitle you don't need to touch this. 
<br><br><b>New line char</b><br>Specifies the character(s) to separate lines in 
subtitles. If you want to make new lines like in SubRip format (without using 
any new line char, just separating lines) then you should write "[Enter]" as the 
new line character. <br><br><b>Load project</b><br>Click this button to load the 
a custom format project from an already saved file (*.cfp). <br><br><b>Save 
project</b><br>Click this button to save the project into a *.cfp file. This 
will save all the information visible on the "Custom formats" dialogue. 
<br><br><b>Text of the custom format script</b><br>This is very simple. The 
parts that Subtitle Workshop will write to a file can be divided in three, and 
in this order: 
<ol>
  <li>A part that is written only once at the <b>beginning</b> of the file 
  </li><li>A part that is <b>repeated</b> each time there is a new subtitle 
  </li><li>A part that is written only once at the <b>end</b> of the file </li></ol>All 
you have to do is to write those three sections in the text box. When you first 
open the "Custom formats" dialogue you can see a commented example. Comments are 
started with ** and are finished with !*. Due to this you can't write the 
characters "<b>**</b>" to a file because it would be understood as a comment 
start. If you want to write this two characters into a file you may use 
<b>{asterisk}</b> (this will write only one asterisk). To write two, 
"{asterisk}*" or "{asterisk}{asterisk}" are the same.<br><br>First write the 
first section (if there is). Then begin the second section (the repeating part) 
with <b>{RepeatSub}</b>. <br><br><b>Repeating section</b><br>In this section it 
is possible to write 4 things. 
<ol>
  <li>The start time of the subtitle. You have to write <b>{swStart}</b> and 
  Subtitle Workshop will replace it by the initial time (or frames) of the 
  actual subtitle. You can also write <b>{swFrameStart}</b> and the program will 
  replace by the frame. In this way you can save the time, for example in 
  hh:mm:ss,zzz:FRAMES format. If you want to put zeros in the left until you 
  reach the desired length, you can write {swFrameStart,DesiredTotalLength}. You 
  can do the same with the end frame. 
  </li><li>The end time of the subtitle. You have to write <b>{swEnd}</b> and 
  Subtitle Workshop will replace it by the final time (or frames) of the actual 
  subtitle. You can also write <b>{swFrameEnd}</b>. 
  </li><li>The subtitle's text. You have to write <b>{swText}</b> and Subtitle 
  Workshop will replace it by the subtitle's text, with the new line char you 
  selected. 
  </li><li>The subtitle count (like in SubRip format). You have to write 
  <b>{SubCount}</b>. This variable holds the actual index of the subtitle. If 
  you are in the first, subtitle, it will be "1", if you are in the second, it 
  will be "2", etc. Some formats like SonicDVD need to add zeros in the left 
  until the length of the number string is for example 4. For this, write 
  <b>{SubCount,DesiredTotalLength}</b> and Subtitle Workshop will add zeros 
  automatically. </li></ol>Check the "CEF Examples" folder, and load some examples 
to see how to use this feature better. <br><br><br><!----------------------------------------------><!--    Chapter 2: Time related features      --><!----------------------------------------------><a name="2.0"></a>
<h2>Chapter 2: Time related features</h2><br><a name="2.1"></a>
<h3>2.1 Framerate conversion</h3>See <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.8">FPS 
and Input FPS</a>. <br><br><br><a name="2.2"></a>
<h3>2.2 Set delay</h3>Subtitle Workshop can set a positive or a negative delay, 
in time or frames. The delay is a fixed time or frames (constant) that 
represents the difference of the points where the subtitles should start, and 
actually start. To apply a delay, first load your subtitle, then click the 
<b>"Edit/Timings/Set delay..."</b> menu or press <b>[Ctrl]+[D]</b> keys. The 
delay dialog will pop up.<br>If you are working in the time mode, you should set 
a time delay and if you are working in the frames mode, you should set a frames 
delay. Subtitle Workshop will automatically detect it. You are able to choose if 
you want to apply the delay to all the subtitles or just to the selected ones, 
useful if only one part of the subtitle gets appears later than it should. 
<br><br><br><a name="2.3"></a>
<h3>2.3 Adjust subtitles</h3>Subtitle Workshop can synchronize subtitles to a 
video by four methods. Whatever method you want to use, the first thing you have 
to do is <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.1">load 
the subtitle file</a> you are going to adjust, and for methods 1, 2 y 4 you need 
to <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.2">load 
the video</a> file you want to take as a reference.<br><a name="2.3.1"></a>
<h5>2.2.1 Method 1: simple adjust, first and last dialogs</h5>This method offers 
a lot of accuracy, and is recommended in most cases. After you loaded the 
subtitle file and video, do this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Play the video until you reach the <b>first spoken dialog</b> or the first 
  place that should be subtitled in the movie, and when you hear/read it, take 
  note the time (you will need it later). 
  </li><li>Seek to the near end of the video and when you hear/read the <b>last 
  spoken dialog</b> or the last place that should be subtitled, take note the 
  time, too. 
  </li><li>You can additionally take this two time values from an external video 
  player instead of using Subtitle Worksop's video preview. 
  </li><li>After you have followed this steps, click the <b>"Edit/Timings/Adjust 
  subtitles..."</b> or the <b>[Ctrl]+[B]</b> keys. Switch to "Simple" tab. In 
  "First spoken line" write the first time, and in "Last spoken line" write the 
  last time. Then press <b>Adjust!</b> button. </li></ul><a name="2.3.2"></a>
<h5>2.2.2 Method 2: synchronize using two points</h5>This method will work very 
well in most cases. It works by taking two points of the subtitle file and two 
points of the video, and calculate the times using a linear algorithm. The first 
pair of points will be called "First sync points" and the last pair of points 
will be called "Last sync points". Each pair of points consist in one point in 
the subtitle and one point in the video, the point in the subtitle has the wrong 
times and the point of the video has the right times. After selecting the first 
sync points and last sync points Subtitle Workshop calculates the rest of the 
times appropriately. The closer first sync points are to the beginning and last 
sync points are to the end, the most accuracy you get. Note: if the point of the 
subtitle selected in the first sync points corresponds to the first subtitle, 
and the point of the subtitle selected in the last sync points corresponds to 
the last subtitle, then the first formula (first and last dialogs) will be 
used.<br><br>After understanding this basics you have to do this:<br>
<ul>
  <li>First of all, select the subtitle you want to mark as first point. The 
  first point in the subtitle will always be the selected subtitle's initial 
  time. 
  </li><li>Play the video until you find the right time for that subtitle (this will 
  be the first point in the video), when you do, click the <b>"Mark as first 
  sync point"</b> button or press the <b>[Ctrl]+[1]</b> keys. 
  </li><li>Now select the subtitle you want to mark as last sync point. The last sync 
  point will be the selected subtitle's initial time. 
  </li><li>Play the video until you find the right time for that subtitle (this will 
  be the last point in the video), when you do, click the <b>"Mark as last sync 
  point"</b> button or press the <b>[Ctrl]+[2]</b> keys. </li></ul>After doing 
this you will get a confirmation message, click "Yes" and the subtitle will be 
instantly synchronized. <a name="2.3.3"></a>
<h5>2.2.3 Method 3: adjust to synchronized subtitles</h5>Useful if you have 
desynchronized subtitles in one language and want to quickly adjust them to an 
already adjusted subtitle file in another language. This method will work even 
if both files have a different number of subtitles, the only requirement for 
proper adjustment is that first and last subtitles in both files correspond - 
that is, mean the same. This method is extremely easy: you just have to click 
the <b>"Timings/Adjust/Adjust to synchronized subtitles"</b> menu or press the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[B]</b> keys, and load the synchronized file. Note: this 
method is <b>NOT</b> the same as the "read times from file" feature. <br><br><a name="2.3.4"></a>
<h5>2.2.4 Method 4: advanced subtitle adjust</h5>Use this if the traditional two 
points adjust fails. This unique feature makes possible to adjust subtitles in 
the worst cases, when desynchronization is not constant, or is different in 
different parts of the subtitle. This system lets you select multiple 
subtitle/video points so that you can synchronize the subtitle by "parts". The 
maximum number of points you can select is the number of subtitles there 
are.<br>For the best performance to be achieved you first have to <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.1">load 
the subtitle file</a> and then <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.2">load 
the corresponding video</a>. In the video preview controls, you will notice that 
last button is "Add subtitle/video synchronization point". You will need this 
button later. This are the steps yous should follow now: 
<ul>
  <li>First of all, select the subtitle you want to mark as point. The point 
  will always be the selected subtitle's initial time. This subtitle can be any 
  subtitle in the file. 
  </li><li>Play the video until you find the right time for that subtitle, when you 
  do, click the <b>"Add subtitle/video synchronization point"</b> button or 
  press the <b>[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[P]</b> keys. The Adjust subtitles window will show, 
  and advanced mode will be set by default. This window is "non-modal", that 
  means, you can still use the main Subtitle Workshop interface while it is 
  opened. 
  </li><li>You need to repeat the two steps above for each point you want to add. You 
  can additionally use the "Add" button to enter a time manually, or the "Add 
  from media" button to add points directly from the Adjust subtitles window 
  (works the same way as the button in the video preview control). </li></ul>A 
<b>very</b> important thing you must know is the use of the <b>"If time is 
outside the points scope"</b> option. I will try to describe the three 
possibilities: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Extrapolate</b>. Subtitle Workshop will use mathematical routines to 
  calculate the times for <i>every subtitle in the file</i> even if it is 
  outside the scope of points. Using this you can have behaviours like the one 
  you would obtain using "synchronize using two points", but with more points. 
  </li><li><b>Return original time (no changes)</b>. If a time is outside the points 
  range and you want to calculate the new time, Subtitle Workshop will return 
  the original time so no changes will be made. This is useful for eg. if you 
  only want to adjust subtitles 100-200 and leave all other subtitles like they 
  are. 
  </li><li><b>Return displacement of neighbour point</b>. If desired time is before 
  first sync point, then it will calculate the new time using the displacement 
  of the first sync point. If desired time is after last sync point, then it 
  will calculate the new time using the displacement of the last sync point. 
  Useful sometimes. </li></ul>When you are done configuring all the settings, 
click the <b>Adjust!</b> button. <br><br><br><a name="2.4"></a>
<h3>2.4 Duration limits</h3>Duration limits makes possible to fix the duration 
of all the subtitles in a file to a range of time. Subtitles which are shown 
less than 1 second are usually hard to read, except if they are short words like 
"Yes" or "Ok". Sometimes there are subtitles with more characters and with short 
duration, or subtitles with durations greater than 10 seconds, this are the 
cases in which you should use this feature. You can set a minimum and maximum 
possible duration for the subtitles. Each subtitle's duration which is shorter 
than the minimum duration allowed will be increased to the minimum possible 
duration you set, without causing overlapping with the next subtitle. Each 
subtitle's duration which is larger than the maximum possible duration will be 
set to the maximum duration you set. <br><br>To set duration limits click the 
<b>"Edit/Timings/Set duration limits..."</b> menu or press the <b>[Ctrl]+[L]</b> 
keys. After that you need to enter the maximum and minimum duration in 
milliseconds and press the <b>Apply</b> button. <br><br><br><a name="2.5"></a>
<h3>2.5 Time expander/reducer</h3>Time expander/reducer is a very nice feature 
in the cases you have a subtitle file that contains some long subtitles with 
short durations. It is close to "Duration limits" but much more useful if the 
file only has long subtitles with short times. This feature lets you expand or 
reduce the duration of certain subtitles under certain conditions. To access to 
time expander/reducer click the <b>"Edit/Timings/Time expander/reducer"</b> menu 
or press <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[Y]</b> keys.<br><br>The amount of time you want to 
expand or reduce the duration is customizable, and may be set in seconds (with a 
precision of up to one millisecond) if you are working in time mode, or in 
frames (with a precision of up to one frame) if you are working in frames mode. 
You can also choose to expand/reduce the duration only under certain conditions, 
only if the subtitle is longer than a customizable number of characters and/or 
only if duration is shorter/longer (depends if you want to expand or reduce 
duration) than a fixed time. Additionally, the "prevent overlapping" check box 
should be checked so that no overlapping errors occur while increasing the final 
time of the subtitles. When you have configured everything, you have to select 
if you want to apply time expander to all the subtitles or only to the selected 
subtitles. To finally expand the durations of the pertinent subtitles, press the 
<b>Apply</b> button. <br><br><br><a name="2.6"></a>
<h3>2.6 Read times from file</h3>Useful if you have one subtitle file in which 
the text of each subtitle is right but the timings are not, and you have another 
file with the same number of subtitles and with the right times. You just have 
to load the file with the right texts, and then click the <b>"Edit/Timings/Read 
timings from file"</b> menu or press the <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[T]</b> keys. A 
dialog will pop up, all you have to do is select the file with the right times 
in that dialog and load it. <br><br><br><a name="2.7"></a>
<h3>2.7 Extend length</h3>"Extend length" works only for the selected subtitles 
and has no effect over the last subtitle of the file. What is does is, extend 
length of each subtitle to one millisecond before the start time of the next 
subtitle. To extend length first select the subtitles you want, and then click 
the <b>"Edit/Timings/Extend length"</b> menu or press the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[E]</b> keys. <br><br><br><a name="2.8"></a>
<h3>2.8 Automatic durations</h3>"Automatic durations" is a very useful feature 
in the cases you have a subtitle file in which the duration of all (or some) 
subtitles is totally wrong. By specifying a time per character, word and line 
(the default values give very good results) Subtitle Workshop will calculate the 
appropiate duration for the subtitle. Another use this feature may have is for 
example when subtitling videos, to go faster you can only set start times 
manually and Subtitle Workshop will calculate all final times. To access 
"Automatic durations" click the <b>"Edit/Timings/Automatic durations"</b> menu 
or the <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[R]</b> keys.<br>You can additionally specify if you 
want to apply new duration in all cases, only if it is greater than original or 
only if it is smaller than original. You can also apply calculated durations to 
all the subtitles or just the selected ones.<br><br>The use of this feature 
together with <a href="Manual.htm#2.4">Duration 
limits</a> and <a href="Manual.htm#5.5.1">Detect 
too long/short durations</a> from Information and Errors can give excellent 
results in a short time. <br><br><br><a name="2.9"></a>
<h3>2.9 Shift subtitles</h3>This feature moves all the selected subtitles 
initial time a specified number of milliseconds forward/backwards, without 
modifying their duration. It is very useful to easily modify timings to 
synchronize with a movie. To shift selected subtitles forward, click the 
<b>"Edit/Timings/Shift +X milliseconds"</b> menu or the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[H]</b> keys. To shift selected subtitles backwards, click the 
<b>"Edit/Timings/Shift -X milliseconds"</b> menu or the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[N]</b> keys. <br><br><br><!--------------------------------------------------------><!--    Chapter 3: Text & subtitles related features    --><!--------------------------------------------------------><a name="3.0"></a>
<h2>Chapter 3: Text &amp; subtitles related features</h2><br>Subtitle Workshop 
isn't just an ordinary subtitle editor - and thus it offers many text related 
functions to ease your work. <br><br><br><a name="3.1"></a>
<h3>3.1 Smart line adjust</h3>Smart line adjust is a very useful feature in the 
case you find a file that has a lot of subtitles that have more than two lines, 
or if the line breaks are just put stupidly. It constrains the subtitle's text 
to be in one or maximum two lines (depending on the length of it). This feature 
has a bit of "-" sign detection. You may choose the length after which the 
subtitle will be in two lines and not in one, in the "Two lines if longer than" 
option in Settings/General.<br><br>To use smart line adjust over a subtitle just 
select it and click the <b>"Edit/Texts/Smart line adjust"</b> menu or press 
<b>[Ctrl]+[E]</b>. Smart line adjust will take effect over all the selected 
subtitles, and they may be more than one. If you are working in translator mode, 
smart line adjust will affect both original and translated text. <br><br>Note 
that smart line adjust is not perfect and it may act badly in some cases, it is 
just thought to help a bit if the lines needed to adjust are a lot, and does its 
job quite well. It may act completely wrongly if there are words composed by the 
"-" sign, although I've added a little detection for words composed with "-" 
sign. If you want to apply Smart Line Adjust over a whole file, you can do it, 
but reading all the subtitle after that is highly recommended. <br><br><br><a name="3.2"></a>
<h3>3.2 Convert case</h3>Have you ever found a unique subtitle file that is all 
in uppercase?, or all in lowercase?. Well, then "Convert case" is your feature. 
To access convert case dialogue click the <b>"Edit/Texts/Convert case..."</b> 
menu or press <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[C]</b>. You are able to select among five 
different case conversion modes: 
<ol>
  <li><b>"Sentence type"</b> only upper cases the first letter of a sentence. It 
  turns "HELLO!, thiS iS VERY nice. i don't WANT tO heAr IT." to "Hello!, this 
  is very nice. I don't want to hear it.".<br><br>if <b>""..." detection"</b> is 
  enabled, it will check if the final three characters of the previous subtitle 
  are "..." and if they are, then it will not uppercase the first character of 
  the current subtitle (it will think it's the continuation of the previous 
  subtitle). If <b>"Only first letter of first word"</b> option is enabled, 
  Subtitle Workshop will uppercase only first letter of each sentence and leave 
  all other words like they are.<br><br>
  </li><li><b>"Lowercase"</b> lower cases the whole text. Turns "HELLO!, thiS iS VERY 
  nice. i don't WANT tO heAr IT." into "hello!, this is very nice. i don't want 
  to hear it." 
  </li><li><b>"Uppercase"</b> upper cases the whole text. Turns "HELLO!, thiS iS VERY 
  nice. i don't WANT tO heAr IT." to "HELLO!, THIS IS VERY NICE. I DON'T WANT TO 
  HEAR IT.". 
  </li><li><b>"Title type"</b> only upper cases the first letter of each word. Turns 
  "HELLO!, thiS iS VERY nice. i don't WANT tO heAr IT." to "Hello!, This Is Very 
  Nice. I Don'T Want To Hear It." 
  </li><li><b>"Inverse type"</b> lower cases the uppercase characters and upper cases 
  the lowercase characters. It reverses case. Turns "HELLO!, thiS iS VERY nice. 
  i don't WANT tO heAr IT." to "hello!, THIs Is very NICE. I DON'T want To HEaR 
  it.". </li></ol>Note that if you are working in translator mode, convert case 
will only work for original text. If you want it to work for translation, then 
use the "Swap" feature. <br><br><br><a name="3.3"></a>
<h3>3.3 Unbreak subtitles</h3>Not much to say about this feature. It takes 
effect over all the selected subtitles, and make each one of them to be in only 
one large line. When working in translator mode, this feature affects the 
original text and also the translation. <br><br><br><a name="3.4"></a>
<h3>3.4 Divide lines</h3>Divides a subtitle into two subtitles. Very useful for 
example if you have a subtitle file with a lot of subtitles with four (or more) 
lines, which are too big to be constrained into two lines with the <a href="Manual.htm#3.1">"Smart 
line adjust"</a> feature. Dividing a subtitle into two manually is possible but 
is a very annoying job, since after you insert the subtitle you also have to set 
all the times and cut text from the first subtitle to put in the second one. 
"Divide lines" does all this very quickly.<br><br>First of all you have to 
select the subtitle, then go to the <b>"Edit/Texts/Divide lines..."</b> menu or 
press <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[D]</b>. Then the "Divide line" dialog will pop up. Note 
that if the selected subtitle has only one line that is shorter than the "Break 
line after" value set in Settings/Advanced, the menu will be disabled and the 
key shortcut will not work.<br>When in the divide line dialog, you are going to 
see two text boxes, one with first subtitle's text and the other one with second 
subtitle's text. You have to select after which line to divide, the default 
value will be correct most of the times. That option will be disabled if the 
subtitle you will divide has only two lines. When you change this value, the 
text of both text boxes will be updated. If you notice that a line break 
disappears in some of the parts, go to Settings/Advanced and uncheck "Smart line 
adjust automatically". If that option is checked, after updating the text of 
each text box, it will be smartly adjusted into one or two lines. If you want to 
do it manually, pass the focus to the desired text box and press 
<b>[Ctrl]+[E]</b>.<br>After this you should focus on the times of the subtitles. 
Most of the times the second subtitle will be displayed immediately after the 
first one, and so it is recommended to leave the "Continue directly" check box 
checked. If the second subtitle should be displayed some time after the first 
one, you have to uncheck the check box and write the start time of the second 
subtitle. Additionally you can use the time proportion buttons available at the 
top of the window. "1:1" means equal duration for both subtitles, "2:1" means 
the first part will be displayed the double time as the second one, etc. You can 
also choose if you want to use the original subtitle's time with proportionality 
buttons or to calculate an automatic duration for each new subtitle. In the 
second case, Subtitle Workshop will calculate the duration of the first new 
subtitle (based on duration per character on the original subtitle) and use it 
to calculate the duration of the second new subtitle.<br><br>Finally press the 
<b>"Divide!"</b> button. When working in translator mode, divide lines will only 
insert an untranslated line in the translation, it will not divide the lines 
since it only works for original subtitle. <br><br><br><a name="3.5"></a>
<h3>3.5 Set maximum line length</h3>Splits the subtitle in N number of lines so 
that each of the lines is shorter than a maximum specified length. That maximum 
length is configurable from Settings/Advanced. This feature affects all the 
selected subtitles, and while in translator mode, affects original and 
translated text.<br><br>Example (Max. line length set to 45):<br><br><b>"This is 
the extremely long text in which we are going to use this feature, that will 
break what you are reading in more lines."</b><br><br>To:<br><br><b>"This is the 
extremely long text in which we<br>are going to use this feature, that 
will<br>break what you are reading in more lines."</b> <br><br>The lines have 
respectively 43, 40 and 41 characters. As you can see, no line exceeds the 
maximum line length.<br>The resulting text doesn't look good on the screen, so 
this feature should be used together with "<a href="Manual.htm#3.4">Divide 
lines</a>". <br><br><br><a name="3.6"></a>
<h3>3.6 Read texts from file</h3>The same as the <a href="Manual.htm#2.6">"Read 
times from file"</a> feature but instead of reading the times it reads the 
texts. <br><br><br><a name="3.7"></a>
<h3>3.7 Combine subtitles</h3>Very useful, combines all the selected subtitles 
into one. For example:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>

    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>- Why don't you do that?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:02,001</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>- I don't know!</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>Becomes:<br><br>

    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>- Why don't you do that?<br>- I don't know! 
</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The final time of the new subtitle becomes the 
final time of the last selected subtitle.<br><br>To combine two or more 
subtitles, select them and press <b>[Ctrl]+[K]</b> or the 
<b>"Edit/Subtitles/Combine subtitles"</b> menu. <br><br><br><a name="3.8"></a>
<h3>3.8 Right-to-left</h3>Features only useful for right to left languages, such 
as Hebrew or Arabic. <br><br><br><a name="3.8.1"></a>
<h5>3.8.1 Reverse text</h5>Reverses the text of all the selected subtitles. 
Example:<br><br><b>"Reverse this text!"</b> to <b>"!txet siht esreveR"</b>. 
<br><br>When in Translator mode, this feature will only work in original text. 
To make it work in translation, use the "Swap" feature.<br>You can specify if 
you want to keep the order of the lines or not, for that, go to Settings/General 
and check or uncheck the "Keep order of lines when reverse text" 
option.<br><br>To reverse the text, select the desired subtitles and press 
<b>[Ctrl]+[H]</b> keys or the <b>"Edit/Subtitles/Right to left/Reverse text"</b> 
menu. <br><br><br><a name="3.8.2"></a>
<h5>3.8.2 Fix punctuation</h5>Fixes punctuation for right to left languages. 
Example:<br><br><b>"Fix this punctuation!..."</b> to <b>"...!Fix this 
punctuation"</b>. <br><br>When in Translator mode, this feature will only affect 
translation. To make it work in original text, use the "Swap" feature or exit 
translator mode.<br>To fix the punctuation, select the desired subtitles and 
press <b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[F]</b> keys or the <b>"Edit/Subtitles/Right to left/Fix 
punctuation"</b> menu. <br><br><br><a name="3.9"></a>
<h3>3.9 Sort</h3>Sorts the subtitles according to their start time. Just press 
<b>[Ctrl]+[Y]</b> or the <b>"Edit/Subtitles/Sort"</b> menu. <br><br><br><a name="3.10"></a>
<h3>3.10 Delete unnecessary links</h3>Deletes "..." when they are placed at the 
end of a subtitle and at the beginning of the next one. Example:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>

    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>But not exactly because...</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:02,001</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>...what I want is 
clear.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Becomes:<br><br>

    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>what I want is clear.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Some people like 
it this way, some other people don't. To delete "unnecessary links" press 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[G]</b> keys or the <b>"Edit/Subtitles/Delete unnecessary 
links"</b> menu. It will make effect over the whole subtitle, not the selected 
subtitles. <br><br><br><a name="3.11"></a>
<h3>3.11 Search &amp; Replace</h3>Subtitle Workshop's Search &amp; Replace is 
very fast and has some extended options available pressing "More &gt;" button. 
Explanation of the options:<br><br><b>Case sensitive</b><br>Performs the 
search/replace being sensitive to UPPERCASE and lowercase 
characters.<br><br><b>Match whole words</b><br>Will find the text only if it's 
forming a word.<br><br><b>Preserve case on replace</b><br>Clones the case of the 
original text when replacing. For eg. text to find is "DOG" and text to replace 
by is "CAT", Subtitle Workshop finds "Dog" and replaces it by "Cat" and not by 
"CAT". <br><br>The text to find or to replace may contain line breaks, and thus 
we can say it can be multi-line. Character "|" (pipe) represents new line. If 
you want to search for "|" then use "||" (two pipes). <br><br><br><a name="3.12"></a>
<h3>3.12 Marked subtitles</h3>This is useful for example if you are translating 
a file, and want to mark certain subtitles because you are not sure about their 
translation. To mark all the selected subtitles, click the 
<b>"Edit/Subtitles/Mark selected subtitles"</b> menu or the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[M]</b> keys. To unmark them click the 
<b>"Edit/Subtitles/Unmark selected subtitles"</b> or the 
<b>[Shift]+[Ctrl]+[A]</b> keys.<br>This feature has other uses, too. It's main 
purpose is to work together with ViPlay. Explanation:<br>While you are watching 
a movie in ViPlay you can use a custom key (eg. "M") to mark the subtitle that 
is currently being displayed (or the last subtitle that has been displayed, if 
any). When you are watching the movie in ViPlay and you see a wrong subtitle 
(spelling mistake, too long duration, over two lines, or any other mistake) and 
you press "M" and it will be marked (internally). When the movie ends, ViPlay 
will ask you to save a Subtitle Report File (*.srf). This file will later be 
loaded by Subtitle Workshop and it will automatically mark the subtitles you 
marked in ViPlay, so you can easily identify them and correct them after 
watching the movie. <br><br><br><!-------------------------------------------><!--    Chapter 4: Settings explained      --><!-------------------------------------------><a name="4.0"></a>
<h2>4.0 Settings explained</h2>Here we will try to explain all the meaning of 
the options available in Settings. <br><br><br><a name="4.1"></a>
<h3>4.1 General</h3><b>Always on top</b><br>Maintains the Subtitle Workshop's 
main window above all the other windows. <br><br><b>Allow more than one instance 
running</b><br>Allows more than one instance of the program running, or only 
one. If this option is unchecked and you open more files via explorer, they will 
all be opened in the same window, and if that option is checked, they will be 
opened in separate windows. <br><br><b>Confirm when deleting subtitles</b><br>If 
this option is checked, each time you try to delete a subtitle or more than one 
in the main list, Subtitle Workshop will show a confirmation message and ask you 
if you are really sure to make the deletion. <br><br><b>Interpret invalid files 
as plain text</b><br>Check this option and you will never get the "The file is 
an invalid subtitle or an unsupported format" error message, but instead, the 
file with actually be loaded (without timings) like if it was plain text. After 
this, you need to set the timings manually. <br><br><b>Autosearch for 
movie</b><br>Each time you open a subtitle file Subtitle Workshop will search 
for the corresponding movie file, and load it. This feature includes suffix 
detection (each suffix has to be separated by ".").<br>Example: if the file name 
of the subtitle is <b>"Spiderman.English.srt"</b> and there is a movie in that 
directory called <b>"Spiderman.avi"</b>, it will be 
loaded.<br><br><br><br><b>Force working in time mode</b><br>If this option is 
unchecked, each time you open a subtitle in a frame based format, Subtitle 
Workshop will automatically switch to frames mode. If not, it will work in time 
mode, but you will be able to switch to frames mode manually. <br><br><b>Keep 
order of lines when reverse text</b><br>Useful for Right-to-Left languages like 
Arabic or Hebrew. Specifies if when you use the "Reverse text" feature 
(<b>[Ctrl]+[H]</b> keys or <b>"Edit/Subtitles/Right to left/Reverse text"</b> 
menu) you want to keep the order of the lines or reverse the text as a whole. 
<br><br><b>Select text on jump to next line</b><br>Specifies if you want to 
select the text in the "Text" or "Translation" text box, when jumping to the 
next line pressing <b>[Shift]+[Enter]</b>. <br><br><b>Select text on jump to 
previous line</b><br>Specifies if you want to select the text in the "Text" or 
"Translation" text box, when jumping to the previous line pressing 
<b>[Ctrl]+[Enter]</b>. <br><br><b>No interaction with tags</b><br>Check this 
option if you want Subtitle Workshop to simply ignore tags when reading files in 
any subtitle format. And ignoring means do not delete them. Useful if you would 
like to work with full support for tags (eg. for one part of the subtitle and 
not just all the subtitle), feature which Subtitle Workshop does not support in 
it's current version. <br><br><b>Work with style tags</b><br>Check this option 
if you want Subtitle Workshop to load and save style and color tags. The number 
of formats that support tags depends on the version of Subtitle API. This option 
doesn't have any effect if "No interaction with tags" is turned on. 
<br><br><b>Recent files limit</b><br>Limit the amount of recent files. If you 
don't want recent files, set the limit to 0. The maximum of recent files is 20. 
<br><br><br><a name="4.1.1"></a>
<h5>4.1.1 Advanced</h5><b>Two lines if longer than</b><br>As the maximum number 
of lines that <a href="Manual.htm#3.1">Smart 
line adjust</a> will produce is two, you have to set a length after which there 
will be two lines instead of one. "Two lines if longer than" is that value. 
<br><br><b>Toggle break point</b><br>Toggles between two break points (first 
space before specified length, or first space after specified length) in some 
subtitles. <br><br><b>Break line after</b><br>Useful to use "Divide lines" in 
subtitles that are only one line, but that line is long. Use this value to 
divide that long line in various smaller lines, that have a maximum of number of 
characters equal to "Break line after" value. <br><br><b>Smart line adjust 
automatically</b><br>Specifies if you want to automatically "Smart line adjust" 
each part in the "Divide lines" window. <br><br><b>Shift time</b><br>Time to 
shift subtitle forwards/backwards with the <a href="Manual.htm#2.9">shift 
subtitles</a> feature. <br><br><a name="4.1.2"></a>
<h5>4.1.2 Charsets</h5><b>Show in main form</b><br>Useful for people working 
with subtitles in various languages who use a different alphabet. Shows 
"Original charset" and "Translation charset" in the main form, so it can be 
quickly modified. <br><br><b>Original charset</b><br>Charset to display 
characters in the "Text" column. <br><br><b>Translation charset</b><br>Charset 
to display characters in the "Translation" column. Only useful if you work in 
translator mode. <br><br><a name="4.2"></a>
<h3>4.2 Formats</h3><b>Default format</b><br>Specifies the default format to use 
in all the windows where there are formats lists (eg. Join subtitles, Split, 
etc). <br><br><b>Formats to show when "Save as"</b><br>Useful if you only work 
with a few formats and you don't want to waste time looking for the desired 
format in a list that contains more than 40 items. Only the checked formats 
listed here will be shown in the "Save as" dialog. <br><br><b>Show custom 
formats</b><br>Specifies if you want to show the custom formats placed on the 
"CustomFormats" folder in the "Save as" window. <br><br><a name="4.3"></a>
<h3>4.3 File types</h3><b>Register extensions on start</b><br>Associate the 
desired subtitle extensions when Subtitle Workshop is executed. 
<br><br><b>Associate with most supported subtitle extensions</b><br>If this 
option is checked, then you just have to double-click on a subtitle file to load 
it into Subtitle Workshop, and the file's icon will become Subtitle Workshop's 
main icon. <br><br><b>List of file extensions</b><br>Files types which will be 
open by Subtitle Workshop when double clicking on file icon. <br><br><a name="4.4"></a>
<h3>4.4 Save</h3><b>Ask to save on exit program/close subtitle</b><br>Subtitle 
Workshop will display the "File has changed. Do you want to save the changes?." 
message when you try to exit program or close subtitle. If you disabled the 
"Allow more than one instance running" option and you try to load a file via 
explorer when there is already a loaded file, this message will be also shown. 
<br><br><b>Save work automatically every X minutes</b><br>Subtitle Workshop will 
silently save the modified subtitle file every the minutes you choose. 
<br><br><b>Save as backup</b><br>Saves the original/translated file as a backup 
(FileName.ext.bak) instead of overwriting the original/translated file. 
<br><br><a name="4.5"></a>
<h3>4.5 Video preview</h3>All the options listed here will work only if you are 
in video preview mode. <b>Double click and shift-double click in a 
subtitle</b><br>You are able to select what to do when you double click in a 
subtitle, and when you double click in a subtitle while holding [Shift] key. The 
available options are three: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Focus text box</b> will pass the focus to the "Text" box, or, if you 
  are in translator mode to the "Translation" box. 
  </li><li><b>Go to subtitles time in video</b> will jump directly to the start time 
  of the subtitle in the video. 
  </li><li><b>Go N seconds before subtitle in video</b> will jump the "Seconds to 
  jump" value before the initial time of the subtitle in the video. 
</li></ol><br><br><b>Rewind and forward times</b><br>Times to rewind/forward 
when pressing the "Rew" and "Forward" buttons in the video controls bar. 
<br><br><b>Default altered playback rate</b><br>The percentage of playback rate 
to apply when pressing the "Alter playback rate" button in the video controls 
bar. <br><br><a name="4.5.1"></a>
<h5>4.5.1 Subtitles</h5><b>Try transparent background</b><br>Enable this check 
box if you want the subtitles to be displayed transparently over the video. This 
option will work most of the times, but if it doesn't work you can check the 
following option: <br><br><b>Force using regions (may be slow)</b><br>If 
checked, the subtitles will be transparent, and should never fail. Use it 
<b>only</b> if you don't get transparent subtitles only with the first option 
enabled and you really want them. If this option is enabled then the text of the 
subtitles can't have the <font color="#ff00ff">FUCHSIA</font> color (#FF00FF). 
<br><br>Most of the other things here don't need any kind of explanation, 
everything you modify can be seen in the "SAMPLE" subtitle. <a name="4.6"></a>
<h3>4.6 External preview</h3>This feature makes possible to preview subtitles in 
your favourite movie player. <a name="4.6.1"></a>
<h5>4.6.1 General</h5><b>Exe of the video player</b><br>The executable file of 
the video player you want to use for external preview. Remember that the video 
player must support command line and external subtitles. <br><br><b>Detect 
associated program</b><br>Press this button if the movie player you want to use 
is associated with .AVI files, and you don't know where to find the executable 
file. <br><br><b>Ask for a different video each time</b><br>Subtitle Workshop 
will ask you to open a video file each time you do the external preview. 
<br><br><b>Always test with same video</b><br>Subtitle Workshop will always use 
the same video for external preview, so it won't ask you anything and will open 
the movie player directly. <br><br><a name="4.6.2"></a>
<h5>4.6.2 Advanced</h5><b>Save temporary file in original format</b><br>Select 
this if you are sure that the video player supports the subtitle format you are 
handling. <br><br><b>Save temporary file in custom format</b><br>If the video 
player doesn't support the subtitle format you are handling, but supports a 
minimum of one of the formats that Subtitle Workshop supports, then check this 
check box and select a format in the list. <br><br><b>Parameter to send the 
video player</b><br>This is <b>very</b> important. Here you have to specify how 
to tell the video player which subtitle and which video file to open. VIDEO_FILE 
represents the video file and SUBT_FILE the subtitle file. Look at the help file 
of the video player to see the specification on the command line 
parameters.<br><br>For details, refer to <a href="Manual.htm#5.7">External 
preview</a>. <br><br><a name="4.7"></a>
<h3>4.7 Look</h3><a name="4.7.1"></a>
<h5>4.7.1 Program</h5><b>Font to use in the program &amp; font size</b><br>If 
you change this, the whole font of the program and/or it's size will be changed. 
Try this if you get problems with the fonts or if you don't like the default 
font. <br><br><b>"Text" and "Translation" fields align</b><br>Choose the text 
alignment that you want for this two fields. <br><br><a name="4.7.2"></a>
<h5>4.7.2 List</h5><b>Show grid lines</b><br>Shows line between the rows and 
columns of the subtitle's list in the main window. <br><br><b>Apply style to 
subtitles</b><br>Only will take effect if a subtitle contains tags (bold, 
italic, underline or color). If this option is checked, Subtitle Workshop will 
draw the subtitle in the list with the appropriate style/color. <br><br><b>Mark 
untranslated subtitles with color</b><br>Draws the untranslated subtitles with a 
particular configurable color, so they can be easily identified. <br><br><b>Show 
horizontal scroll bar</b><br>Uncheck this option and you will never get the 
horizontal scrollbar in the main list. <br><br><a name="4.7.3"></a>
<h5>4.7.3 Menu</h5><b>Use Office XP style menu</b><br>Uses the custom menu &amp; 
popup menu in the main form. If you turn this off, the default Windows menus 
will be used. <br><br><b>Use gradient menu</b><br>Draws a gradient in the left 
of the menus. <br><br><br><!------------------------------><!--    Chapter 5: Tools      --><!------------------------------><a name="5.0"></a>
<h2>Chapter 5: Tools</h2>Must-have features in every subtitle tool. <br><br><a name="5.1"></a>
<h3>5.1 Spell check</h3>This spell check uses Microsoft Word's spell check 
engine, connecting to it through OLE technology. Thus, at least Microsoft Word 
97 is required. To spell check a subtitle just load it and press <b>F7</b> key 
or the <b>"Tools/Spell check"</b> menu. All the errors and suggestions will be 
shown using Word's default windows. The spell check should support any installed 
dictionary.<br><br><b>Note:</b> this feature may give errors (TOleExeption) some 
times, this is not because of Subtitle Workshop, but because of Word. But 
anyway, it works pretty well most of the time. <br><br><br><a name="5.2"></a>
<h3>5.2 Batch convert</h3>This feature lets you convert a large number of 
subtitle files in any format to a single format, and then save them in the path 
you wish with only few clicks.<br><br>Click the <b>"Tools/Batch convert..."</b> 
menu or press <b>[Ctrl]+[M]</b>. After doing this, you should follow this 
steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Select what <b>file extensions to search for</b>, all the possible 
  extensions are shown on the left. 
  </li><li>Select the <b>search path</b> (the folder in which the subtitle files you 
  want to convert are) 
  </li><li>If you want to include subfolders in the search, check the "Include 
  subfolders" check box. 
  </li><li>If you want Subtitle Workshop to make an exhaustive format check, check 
  the "Exhaustive format check" check box. If this option is off, Subtitle 
  Workshop will skim the file to see if it is a valid file and in what format it 
  is. Skimming usually works very well, and it gives an excellent speed. If you 
  want to perform throughout tests through the file, with an effectivity of 
  100%, then use exhaustive check. Exhaustive check is remarkably slower than 
  standard check. 
  </li><li>Select the <b>output directory</b> (the path in which the converted files 
  will be saved) 
  </li><li>Select the <b>output format</b>. 
  </li><li>Select the Default FPS for the frame based files (if there are). 
  </li><li>Press the <b>"Next"</b> button. </li></ol>After pressing the button, 
Subtitle Workshop will search for valid subtitle files in the search path you 
chose.<br><br>When searching finishes, you will see a list with all the found 
files, format, FPS (for frame based subtitles - this value should be by default, 
the same as "Default FPS" you set) and size (in Kb).<br>You may add new files to 
the list, or remove files. You can also change FPS of a frame based file (or 
many files at one time), selecting it and changing the box that is at the left 
of the "Clear" button.<br><br>Finally, press the <b>Convert</b> button and 
conversion should start. When it finishes, Subtitle Workshop will generate a log 
(*.log) file, reporting all the possible errors together with the successes.

<h3>5.3 Split subtitles</h3>There are two possible splits: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Simple</b> - splits subtitle file in two parts 
  </li><li><b>Advanced</b> - splits subtitle file in an indefinite number of parts 
  </li></ol>Use the one that best fits your needs.<br><br><b>Simple 
split</b><br>You first have to choose where to split the file, you have 5 
possibilities: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Split in selected item</b><br>The subtitle file will be split right 
  after the item that is selected in the main window. 
  </li><li><b>Split in item number</b><br>The subtitle file will be split in the item 
  you select. 
  </li><li><b>Split in given time</b><br>The subtitle file will be split in the first 
  subtitle which's initial time is greater than the time you select. 
  </li><li><b>Split in given frame</b><br>The subtitle file will be split in the 
  first subtitle which's initial frame is greater than the frame you select. 
  </li><li><b>Split in end of video</b><br>The subtitle file will be split in the 
  first subtitle which's initial time is greater than the time in which a video 
  ends (the video's duration). </li></ol>After selecting where to split select the 
file names (excluding the extension, it will be added automatically), the output 
format and press the <b>Split</b> button. <br><br><b>Advanced 
split</b><br>Switch to the Advanced page, and then select the number of parts 
you want to make. You have to select if you want to make the parts equal in time 
(length), in lines or if you want to split at the end of multiple videos.<br>If 
you want to split at the end of multiple videos you need to select a video for 
each part, to do so double click in each part in the list starting with the 
first one. You can't select a video for the last part since it will be 
calculated automatically.<br><br>Leave the "Auto-name the parts" check box 
checked if you want Subtitle Workshop to set the file names of the parts 
automatically, if you want to do it manually, uncheck the check box, select the 
desired part &amp; press <b>F2</b> to type the name.<br><br>Check "Recalculate 
time values" if you want Subtitle Workshop to automatically set a delay to the 
second subtitle so you don't have to do it manually after spliting. Finally 
select the output path, the output format and press the <b>Split</b> button. 
<br><br><br><a name="5.4"></a>
<h3>5.4 Join subtitles</h3>With Subtitle Workshop you can join more than two 
subtitles, and those subtitles may be in different formats, time or frame based, 
and if frame based, they even may have different FPS!<br>Click the 
<b>"Tools/Join subtitles..."</b> menu or press <b>[Ctrl]+[J]</b>.<br><br>Now 
press the <b>Add</b> button and add all the files you want, in the correct 
order. If you made a mistake in the order of one file you may drag it with the 
mouse and put it where you want. If the file is a frame based subtitle you may 
also modify it's FPS selecting it and modifying the value of the combo box that 
is at the left of the "Clear" button. You can do that operation to all selected 
frame based subtitles at one time.<br>Optionally, may set a movie fragment for 
each part (except of course the last) so Subtitle Workshop will make all changes 
in the timings of subtitles automatically. This way you won't need to make any 
changes to the resulting file. To select a movie fragment for each part select 
it and click the <b>Set movie fragment</b> button. If you made a mistake, select 
that part and press the <b>Delete movie fragment</b> button. Now need to select 
the <b>output format</b>, and if it is a frame based one, the <b>output FPS</b>. 
If you want to load the resulting file, check the "Load file after joining and 
saving" check box. Check the "Recalculate time values" if you want Subtitle 
Workshop to automatically set the delay to all the subtitles beginning in the 
second one, so you don't have to do it manually. This option will not work if 
the parts are associated to movie fragments. Finally, press the <b>Join</b> 
button. <br><br><br><a name="5.5"></a>
<h3>5.5 Information and errors</h3>This is one of the features that make 
Subtitle Workshop unique - despite of other program's attempt to imitate it, 
Subtitle Workshop's Information and Errors still has the best performance, 
flexibility and options. <br><br><a name="5.5.1"></a>
<h5>5.5.1 Errors &amp; fixes explained</h5>Information and Errors can check for 
and fix a large variety of common errors in subtitles, here we will try to 
review all the possible errors and the way(s) they are automatically fixed. 
Before we do it is important to know what types of errors are going to be fixed 
first. The priorities are: 
<ol>
  <li>Lines without letters 
  </li><li>Empty subtitles 
  </li><li>Repeated subtitles 
  </li><li>Prohibited characters 
  </li><li>Text before colon (":") 
  </li><li>Hearing impaired 
  </li><li>Overlapping 
  </li><li>Bad values 
  </li><li>Unnecessary dots 
  </li><li>Repeated character 
  </li><li>OCR Errors 
  </li><li>"- " in subtitles with one line 
  </li><li>Space after custom characters 
  </li><li>Space before custom characters 
  </li><li>Unnecessary spaces 
  </li><li>Subtitle over two lines 
  </li><li>Too long duration (only check) 
  </li><li>Too short duration (only check) 
  </li><li>Too long lines (only check) </li></ol>Errors 1 to 6 are first because when 
fixing that type of errors, the subtitle can get deleted under certain 
circumstances, so if for example time fixings were first, it would lead to a 
time fix and then to delete the subtitle, and that is pointless. 
<br><br><br><b>Lines without letters</b><br>Deletes lines of the subtitle that 
don't contain letters (a-z, á-í, etc). Example: 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:00,250</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:01,350</b></td>
    <td><b>This is the text 1<br>!!!!!!!</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:00,780</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,150</b></td>
    <td><b>¿?!¡<br>This is the text 2</b></td></tr></tbody></table>In both cases, 
Subtitle Workshop will delete second and first lines respectively, because they 
do not contain letters (don't misunderstand, "letters" is not the same as 
"characters"). <br><br><br><b>Empty subtitles</b><br>An empty subtitle can be: 
<ol>
  <li>A subtitle that contains <b>no text at all</b> (blank text). 
  </li><li>A subtitle that doesn't contain <b>any letter or number</b>. Eg. the text: 
  "- !!!!"<br></li></ol>In both cases, Subtitle Workshop will delete the subtitle. 
<br><br><br><b>Repeated subtitles</b><br>This is very common in OCRs. 
Example:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:01,010</b></td>
    <td><b>Come on, let's book.</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,010</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>Come on, let's book.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>Repeated 
subtitles are characterized by two things: 
<ol>
  <li>The text is <b>exactly</b> the same. 
  </li><li>Usually one subtitle has a very short duration, most of the times it is 
  the first one (like in the example) but can be the other way round. </li></ol>In 
the example above, the start time of second subtitle is exactly the final time 
of the first, this is very common, but it's not like this always. That's why the 
"Tolerance for repeated subtitles" value is configurable, it is the maximum 
difference between FinalTime1 and InitialTime2 admittible to detect a subtitle 
as a repeated subtitle. After fixing, the final subtitle will look like 
this:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>Come on, let's book.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The start time will 
be the start time of the first subtitle, and the final time will be the final 
time of the last subtitle. <br><br><br><b>Prohibited characters</b><br>Finds 
subtitles that contains prohibited characters and delete them (the whole 
subtitle - not the characters). <br><br><br><b>Text before colon 
(":")</b><br>The text before colon is usually for deaf people. Most of the times 
it represents the name of the person who is currently 
speaking.<br><br>Example:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>MAN:|She feel the same about you?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:04,000</b></td>
    <td><b>JERRY:|I don't know.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>In 80% of the 
cases, the text before colon will usually be all in CAPITAL LETTERS, so you can 
enable the "Only if text is in capital letters" option, and thus avoid many kind 
of problems, eg. with this kind of subtitles "I'm going to tell you 
something:|Don't ever do that again". After fixing, the text will be: <br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>She feel the same about you?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:04,000</b></td>
    <td><b>I don't know.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The detection for the 
colon will not detect it if it is between two numbers, eg. "12:30", and thus it 
will avoid problems with times. <br><br><br><b>Hearing impaired 
subtitles</b><br>Hearing impaired subtitles are whole subtitles, or just part of 
a subtitle, that are exclusively for deaf people. Most of the people don't want 
"noises" and "sounds" inside their subtitles, so they want to eliminate them. 
Deaf people shouldn't use this feature, of course. Hearing impaired subtitles 
are usually enclosed in parenthesis ("(" and ")" and/or "[" and 
"]").<br><br>Example:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>

    <td><b>You want me to kill him for you?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>

    <td><b>Yeah. Would you?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:05,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:06,000</b></td>
    <td><b>[Shutter Whirring,</b></td>
    <td><b>Clicking Off]</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>First subtitle 
contains a part for hearing impaired, and third subtitle is all for hearing 
impaired. So, after fixing, this will result in:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:01,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,000</b></td>
    <td><b>You want me to kill him for you?</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:03,000</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:04,000</b></td>
    <td><b>Yeah. Would you?</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><b>Overlapping 
subtitles</b><br>This error is produces whenever a subtitle appears in the 
screen sonner than the time in which previous subtitle is hidden. That is to 
say, when the final time of a subtitle is greater than the initial time of the 
next one. Let's see this example to see it clearly:<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Start time</b></td>
    <td><b>Final time</b></td>
    <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:00,250</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:01,350</b></td>
    <td><b>This is the text 1</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>00:00:00,780</b></td>
    <td><b>00:00:02,150</b></td>
    <td><b>This is the text 2</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Subtitle number two 
is shown before subtitle number one is hidden. Subtitle Workshop will fix this 
acting appropiately, depending of the length of the texts of the subtitles. 
There are three possible solutions: 
<ol>
  <li>If the <b>difference between the length</b> of the text of both subtitles 
  is <b>less than 5</b>, the length for each subtitle will be set appropiately. 
  That is, the duration of each subtitle will be: <b>(FinalTime2 - InitialTime1) 
  div 2.</b><br><br>This is the case of the example above, the solution for 
  overlapping is this one since the length of both texts is equal.<br>Subtitle 
  Workshop will fix the subtitles like this:<br><br>
  <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Start time</b></td>
      <td><b>Final time</b></td>
      <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>00:00:00,250</b></td>
      <td><b>00:00:01,200</b></td>
      <td><b>This is the text 1</b></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>00:00:01,201</b></td>
      <td><b>00:00:02,150</b></td>
      <td><b>This is the text 2</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>As you can see, 
  (2150-250) div 2 = a duration of 950 Milliseconds for each subtitle, and as it 
  is impossible to give the 950 milliseconds to the second subtitle (we need one 
  extra millisecond for that) we give it 949. <br><br><br>
  </li><li>If the text of first subtitle is more than 4 characters longer than the 
  text of second one, second subtitle's time will be cut. Subtitle Workshop will 
  fix the example like this:<br><br>
  <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Start time</b></td>
      <td><b>Final time</b></td>
      <td><b>Text</b></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>00:00:00,250</b></td>
      <td><b>00:00:01,350</b></td>
      <td><b>This is the text 1. More than four extra characters.</b></td></tr>
    <tr>
      <td><b>00:00:01,351</b></td>
      <td><b>00:00:02,150</b></td>
      <td><b>This is the text 2</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br>So as we cut second 
  subtitle's initial time, the duration will obviously be less than the duration 
  of the first subtitle. In this case we have got 1100 milliseconds for the 
  first subtitle and 799 for the second. <br><br><br>
  </li><li>If the text of second subtitle is more than 4 characters longer than the 
  text of first one, first subtitle's time will be cut. Subtitle Workshop will 
  fix the example like this:<br><br>
  <table>

    characters.</b></td></tr></tbody></table>The duration of the first subtitle is 
  529 milliseconds, and the duration of the second one is 1370 milliseconds. 
  </li></ol><br><b>Bad values</b><br>Bad values is when the initial time of a 
subtitle is greater than it's final time.<br><br>Example:<br><br>

fix that by inverting the time values, so the subtitle would be:<br><br>

with every repeatable character. The default characters are "-¡!¿?",;\/_[]=", 
you may add/remove characters if you want, from Information and Errors settings. 
<br><br><br><b>OCR Errors</b><br>As different languages have different OCR 
errors, the OCR scripts were born. For more information on the scripts, refer <a href="Manual.htm#5.5.3">here</a>. 
<br><br><br><b>"-" in subtitles with one line</b><br>There is no sense in having 
subtitles with one line starting with "-" (open dialog) since only one person 
speaks in them. Thus, if you enable this option, Subtitle Workshop will delete 
the "-" if the subtitle contains only one line. <br><br><br><b>Space after 
custom characters</b><br>Adds a space (if not present) after any of the 
characters in "Space after characters" in Information and Errors's 
settings/Advanced. Useful for example to add a space after the dialog start to 
turn:<br><br><b>-This is it.<br>-Really</b><br><br>To:<br><br><b>- This is 
it.<br>- Really</b><br><br>This feature has a bit of composed words detection, 
so it doesn't add a space after the character in words like "multi-line". 
<br><br><br><b>Space before custom characters</b><br>Adds a space (if not 
present) before any of the characters in "Space before characters" in 
Information and Errors's settings/Advanced. Useful for example for french 
language, to add spaces before "?", "!" and ":". <br><br><br><b>Unnecessary 
spaces</b><br>This is a must. Eliminates the unnecessary spaces you choose from 
the text of a subtitle file. Currently this type of spaces can be removed: 
<ol>
  <li>Enters and spaces at the beginning and end 
  </li><li>Spaces between enters (left and right) 
  </li><li>Double spaces and enters (double enter = blank line) 
  </li><li>Spaces in front of punctuation marks 
  </li><li>Spaces after "¿" and "¡" 
  </li><li>Spaces before "?" and "!" 
  </li><li>Spaces between numbers </li></ol>As different languages may require 
different spacings, all the types of spaces to remove are configurable. 
<br><br><br><b>Subtitles over two lines</b><br>Just checks if a subtitle has 
three or more lines, and uses <a href="Manual.htm#3.1">Smart 
line adjust</a> to fix it. <br><br><br><b>Too long/short 
duration</b><br>Subtitle Workshop can identify if the duration of a subtitle is 
longer/shorter that a specified minimum/maximum value and report it to you. 
Subtitles with too short duration can be unreadable and subtitles with too long 
duration can be annoying. This error must be fixed manually. <br><br><br><b>Too 
long lines</b><br>Detects if a subtitle contains lines that are longer than a 
specified number of characters. Too long lines can exceed the width of the 
screen in some video players and this is potentially dangerous. <br><br><br><a name="5.5.2"></a>
<h5>5.5.2 Settings explained</h5>To access to Information and Errors Settings, 
press <b>[Alt]+[I]</b> keys or the <b>"Tools/Information and 
errors/Settings..."</b> menu. Additionally you can access this Settings from the 
Information and Errors window, pressing the "Settings" button.<br>Now let's 
review all the options you will find.<br><br>
<h5>General options</h5><b>Mark errors in main form's list</b><br>You are able 
to let Subtitle Workshop mark the errors in the main list by enabling this 
option. You can specify Font Color/Style (bold, italic, underline).<br>If the 
errors are marked in the main list, it is very easy to fix them manually, and in 
a lot of cases this is very useful. For example, if you have lots of long three 
lines subtitles you can mark them in a certain color, and then fix them all (one 
by one) using <a href="Manual.htm#3.4">Divide 
lines</a>.<br>If the marked error is difficult to identify visually (for example 
it is very hard sometimes to tell that a subtitle has got unnecessary spaces or 
unnecessary dots) you can put the mouse over the subtitle with errors for half a 
second and you'll get a description specifying exactly what type of error it 
has. <br><br><b>Mark errors on load subtitle</b><br>If this option is enabled, 
it performs an automated check for errors each time you load a subtitle file. 
This option is going to take effect only if "Mark errors in main form's list" is 
enabled. <br><br><b>Fix errors on load subtitle</b><br>Automatically fixes all 
the errors when the subtitle is loaded. <br><br><b>Fix one unit overlap at 
load</b><br>Fixes the most common overlapping when the subtitle is loaded.

option is very safe. <br><br><b>OCR Script:</b><br>Specifies the name of the OCR 
Script you are currently using. This script has to be in the "OCRScripts" folder 
inside Subtitle Workshop's directory. All the scripts listed here are all the 
".ocr" files found in the above mentioned folder. The "Edit" button will open 
Notepad so you can edit the file manually, add or remove possible OCR Errors.

<h5>Advanced options</h5><b>Repeatable characters</b><br>Specifies all the 
characters that can be repeated, and that are going to be fixed if the "Repeated 
characters" fixing is enabled. <br><br><b>Prohibited characters</b><br>Specifies 
all the characters that can't be in any subtitle, if the "Prohibited characters" 
fixing is enabled and a subtitle contains any of this characters, it will be 
deleted. <br><br><b>Tolerance for repeated subtitles</b><br>Specifies the 
maximum admittible difference between final time of the first subtitle and 
initial time of the second one to detect and eventually fix a repeated subtitle. 
<br><br><b>Space after characters</b><br>Specifies all the characters to use 
with the "Space after custom characters" repair. The characters have to be one 
after the other (not separated by comma or whatever). <br><br><b>Space before 
characters</b><br>The same as above but this characters will be used with the 
"Space before custom characters" repair. <br><br><b>Too long 
duration</b><br>Specifies the value after which a duration is considered as too 
long. <br><br><b>Too short duration</b><br>Specifies the value before which a 
duration is considered as too short. <br><br><b>Too long line</b><br>Specifies 
the number of characters after which a line is considered as too long. <br><br>
<h5>Check for, fix, unnecessary spaces</h5>You are able to choose what errors to 
check for, and what errors to fix. And also, you can choose what unnecessary 
spaces to check for and what to fix. <br><br><br><a name="5.5.3"></a>
<h5>5.5.3 OCR Scripts</h5>The OCR Scripts are nothing but a serie of 
Find-ReplaceBy specifications in a human-friendly close to HTML syntax. What 
makes them powerful?. The commands that are available. The possibility of using 
regular expression makes possible for you to find and replace almost anything 
needed in any language. A <b>very</b> important thing to know about OCR Scripts 
is that all commands are performed consecutively, that is, in the order they are 
written. <br>Let's now see a small example of an OCR Script: <pre>&lt;SWOCR WordChars="0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_ñÑáéíóúÁÉÍÓÚäëïöü"&gt;
	&lt;!-- The comments are set just like in HTML --&gt;
	&lt;ERROR Find="[A-ZÁ-Ú](l)" ReplaceBy="I"&gt;
	&lt;ERROR Find="[a-zá-ú](I)" ReplaceBy="l"&gt;
	&lt;ERROR Find="\d( :)" ReplaceBy=":"&gt;
	&lt;ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="False" Find=",{2,}" ReplaceBy="..."&gt;
&lt;/SWOCR&gt;
</pre>WordChars represents all the charcters that can form a word in your 
language. The default is the string shown above. If no parameter is passed, the 
default will be used. This are one of the most common OCR errors in English 
language, as in OCR Engines, "l" (small "L") and "I" (big "i") have no 
difference at all, they are often misplaced. Another very common error is the 
inclussion of spaces before colon. In the short example above Subtitle Workshop 
will use regular expressions on the search for errors. And if we don't want to 
use regular expressions?. For that we need to take a look at the parameters that 
define how you want the search to be made:<br><br><b>UseRE</b><br>UseRE="True" 
or UseRE="False". The default value is True. If it is set to false then regular 
expressions will not be used in the search. Use it as False only if you want to 
simplify the way find-replace commands are written, because if regular 
expressions are disabled then the OCR scripts have few power. 
<br><br><b>UseREOnlyToFind</b><br>UseREOnlyToFind="True" or 
UseREOnlyToFind="False". The default value is True. To explain how this works we 
need to see an example:<br><pre>&lt;ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="True" Find="[a-z]at" ReplaceBy="dog"&gt;
</pre>Applied to <i>"The name of my <b>cat</b> is Max"</i> will return <i>"The 
name of my <b>dog</b> is Max"</i>, but <pre>&lt;ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="False" Find="[a-z](at)" ReplaceBy="dog"&gt;
</pre>Applied to <i>"The name of my <b>cat</b> is Max"</i> will return <i>"The 
name of my <b>cdog</b> is Max"</i>.<br><br>In the first situation, when we are 
about to replace we also replace the part that is a regular expression (in this 
case "[a-z]", matching "c" this time).<br>In the second situation, when we are 
about to replace we only use the regular expression part ("[a-z]") to search for 
the text, but we don't use it to replace. We will only replace the part o the 
"Find=" text that is <b>between parenthesis</b>, that is, you need to write the 
normal regular expression and the part that is "constant" and won't vary between 
parenthesis. This is extremely useful for the OCR Scripts (take a deep look at 
Default.ocr to understand). <br><br>The following parameters are only available 
when "UseRE" is set to false:<br><br><b>WholeWord</b><br>WholeWord="True" or 
WholeWord="False". Setting it to False is the same as not including it. If true, 
it will find the "Find=" text only if it is forming a Word. 
<br><br><b>CaseSensitive</b><br>CaseSensitive="True" or CaseSensitive="False". 
Setting it to False is the same as not including it. If true, it will be case 
sensitive while finding the text. <br><br>This are the most used commands, you 
can do a lot with them. But there are more:<br><br><b>PreserveCase</b><br>The 
default value is False. If true, it will preserve the case of "Find" text when 
replacing to "ReplaceBy" text. For example, if we have this error: <pre>&lt;ERROR UseRE="False" Find="DOG" WholeWord="True" PreserveCase="True" ReplaceBy="CAT"&gt;
</pre>As it is not case sensitive, we suppose Subtitle Workshop finds the text 
"Dog" and not "DOG". When replacing to "CAT", it will clone the case of the text 
it found, so it will replace "Dog" by "Cat" and not by "CAT". <br><br><a name="5.5.4"></a>
<h5>Syntax of Regular Expressions</h5>
<h5>Introduction</h5><i>This document is taken from TRegExpr help file, an 
excellent Regular Expressions library for Delphi, by Andrey V. Sorokin.</i> 
<br><br>Regular Expressions are a widely-used method of specifying patterns of 
text to search for. Special metacharacters allow You to specify, for instance, 
that a particular string You are looking for occurs at the beginning or end of a 
line, or contains n recurrences of a certain character.<br>Regular expressions 
look ugly for novices, but really they are very simple (well, usually simple ;) 
), handly and powerfull tool. <br><br>I strongly recommend you to play with 
regular expressions. Let's start our learning trip! <br><br>
<h5>Simple matches</h5>Any single character matches itself, unless it is a 
<b>metacharacter</b> with a special meaning described below.<br><br>A series of 
characters matches that series of characters in the target string, so the 
pattern "bluh" would match "bluh" in the target string. Quite simple, 
eh?<br><br>You can cause characters that normally function as 
<b>metacharacters</b> or <b>escape sequences</b> to be interpreted literally by 
'escaping' them by preceding them with a backslash "\", for instance: 
metacharacter "^" match beginning of string, but "\^" match character "^", "\\" 
match "\" and so on.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>foobar</td>
    <td><i>matchs string 'foobar'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\^FooBarPtr</td>
    <td><i>matchs '^FooBarPtr'</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
<h5>Escape sequences</h5>Characters may be specified using a <b>escape 
sequences</b> syntax much like that used in C and Perl: "\n'' matches a newline, 
"\t'' a tab, etc. More generally, \xnn, where nn is a string of hexadecimal 
digits, matches the character whose ASCII value is nn. If You need wide 
(Unicode) character code, You can use '\x{nnnn}', where 'nnnn' - one or more 
hexadecimal digits.<br><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>\xnn</td>
    <td><i>char with hex code nn</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\x{nnnn}</td>
    <td><i>char with hex code nnnn (one byte for plain text and two bytes for 
      Unicode)</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\t</td>
    <td><i>tab (HT/TAB), same as \x09</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\n</td>
    <td><i>newline (NL), same as \x0a</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\r</td>
    <td><i>car.return (CR), same as \x0d</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\f</td>
    <td><i>form feed (FF), same as \x0c</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\a</td>
    <td><i>alarm (bell) (BEL), same as \x07</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\e</td>
    <td><i>escape (ESC), same as 
\x1b</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br><b>Examples:</b><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>foo\x20bar</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'foo bar' (note space in the middle)</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\tfoobar</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'foobar' predefined by tab</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h5>Character classes</h5>You can specify a <b>character class</b>, by enclosing 
a list of characters in [], which will match any one character from the list. 
<br><br>If the first character after the "['' is "^'', the class matches any 
character <b>not</b> in the list. <br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>foob[aeiou]r</td>
    <td><i>finds strings 'foobar', 'foober' etc. but not 'foobbr', 'foobcr' 
      etc.</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foob[^aeiou]r</td>
    <td><i>find strings 'foobbr', 'foobcr' etc. but not 'foobar', 'foober' 
      etc.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Within a list, the "-'' character is used 
to specify a <b>range</b>, so that a-z represents all characters between "a'' 
and "z'', inclusive.<br><br>If you want "-'' itself to be a member of a class, 
put it at the start or end of the list, or escape it with a backslash. If you 
want ']' you may place it at the start of list or escape it with a backslash. 
<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>[-az]</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[az-]</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[a\-z]</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[a-z]</td>
    <td><i>matchs all twenty six small characters from 'a' to 'z'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[\n-\x0D]</td>
    <td><i>matchs any of #10,#11,#12,#13.</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[\d-t]</td>
    <td><i>matchs any digit, '-' or 't'.</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[]-a]</td>
    <td><i>matchs any char from ']'..'a'.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h5>Metacharacters</h5>Metacharacters are special characters which are the 
essence of Regular Expressions. There are different types of metacharacters, 
described below. <br><br><b>Metacharacters - line separators</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>^</td>
    <td><i>start of line</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$</td>
    <td><i>end of line</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\A</td>
    <td><i>start of text</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\Z</td>
    <td><i>end of text</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>.</td>
    <td><i>any character in 
line</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br><b>Examples:</b><br>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>^foobar</td>
    <td><i>matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the beginning of 
  line</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foobar$</td>
    <td><i>matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the end of line</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>^foobar$</td>
    <td><i>matchs string 'foobar' only if it's the only string in 
  line</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foob.r</td>
    <td><i>matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobbr', 'foob1r' and so 
  on</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>The "^" metacharacter by default is only 
guaranteed to match at the beginning of the input string/text, the "$" 
metacharacter only at the end. Embedded line separators will not be matched by 
"^'' or "$''.<br>You may, however, wish to treat a string as a multi-line 
buffer, such that the "^'' will match after any line separator within the 
string, and "$'' will match before any line separator. You can do this by 
switching On the modifier /m.<br>The \A and \Z are just like "^'' and "$'', 
except that they won't match multiple times when the modifier /m is used, while 
"^'' and "$'' will match at every internal line separator.<br><br>The ".'' 
metacharacter by default matches any character, but if You switch Off the 
modifier /s, then '.' won't match embedded line separators.<br><br>TRegExpr 
works with line separators as recommended at www.unicode.org 
(http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/):<br><br>"^" is at the beginning 
of a input string, and, if modifier /m is On, also immediately following any 
occurrence of \x0D\x0A or \x0A or \x0D (if You are using Unicode version of 
TRegExpr, then also \x2028 or \x2029 or \x0B or \x0C or \x85). Note that there 
is no empty line within the sequence \x0D\x0A.<br><br>"$" is at the end of a 
input string, and, if modifier /m is On, also immediately preceding any 
occurrence of \x0D\x0A or \x0A or \x0D (if You are using Unicode version of 
TRegExpr, then also \x2028 or \x2029 or \x0B or \x0C or \x85). Note that there 
is no empty line within the sequence \x0D\x0A.<br><br>"." matchs any character, 
but if You switch Off modifier /s then "." doesn't match \x0D\x0A and \x0A and 
\x0D (if You are using Unicode version of TRegExpr, then also \x2028 and \x2029 
and \x0B and \x0C and \x85).<br><br>Note that "^.*$" (an empty line pattern) 
doesnot match the empty string within the sequence \x0D\x0A, but matchs the 
empty string within the sequence \x0A\x0D.<br><br>Multiline processing can be 
easely tuned for Your own purpose with help of TRegExpr properties 
LineSeparators and LinePairedSeparator, You can use only Unix style separators 
\n or only DOS/Windows style \r\n or mix them together (as described above and 
used by default) or define Your own line separators!<br><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - predefined classes</h5>

      'foob1r', 'foob=r' and so on</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>TRegExpr uses 
properties SpaceChars and WordChars to define character classes \w, \W, \s, \S, 
so You can easely redefine it.<br><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - word boundaries</h5>
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>\b</td>
    <td><i>Match a word boundary</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\B</td>
    <td><i>Match a non-(word boundary)</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>A word 
boundary (\b) is a spot between two characters that has a \w on one side of it 
and a \W on the other side of it (in either order), counting the imaginary 
characters off the beginning and end of the string as matching a \W.<br><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - iterators</h5>Any item of a regular expression may be 
followed by another type of metacharacters - <b>iterators</b>. Using this 
metacharacters you can specify number of occurences of previous character, 
<b>metacharacter</b> or <b>subexpression</b>.<br>
<table>

  <tr>
    <td>*</td>
    <td><i>zero or more ("greedy"), similar to {0,}</i></td></tr>

  ("non-greedy")</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>So, digits in curly brackets of 
the form {n,m}, specify the minimum number of times to match the item n and the 
maximum m. The form {n} is equivalent to {n,n} and matches exactly n times. The 
form {n,} matches n or more times. There is no limit to the size of n or m, but 
large numbers will chew up more memory and slow down r.e. execution.<br><br>If a 
curly bracket occurs in any other context, it is treated as a regular 
character.<br><br><b>Examples:</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>foob.*r</td>
    <td><i>matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobalkjdflkj9r' and 
  'foobr'</i></td></tr>

    <td><i>matchs strings like 'foobaar', 'foobaaar', 'foobaaaar' 
  etc.</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>fooba{2,3}r</td>
    <td><i>matchs strings like 'foobaar', or 'foobaaar' but not 
    'foobaaaar'</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>A little explanation about 
"greediness". "Greedy" takes as many as possible, "non-greedy" takes as few as 
possible. For example, 'b+' and 'b*' applied to string 'abbbbc' return 'bbbb', 
'b+?' returns 'b', 'b*?' returns empty string, 'b{2,3}?' returns 'bb', 'b{2,3}' 
returns 'bbb'.<br><br>You can switch all iterators into "non-greedy" mode (see 
the modifier /g).<br><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - alternatives</h5>You can specify a series of 
<b>alternatives</b> for a pattern using "|'' to separate them, so that 
fee|fie|foe will match any of "fee'', "fie'', or "foe'' in the target string (as 
would f(e|i|o)e). The first alternative includes everything from the last 
pattern delimiter ("('', "['', or the beginning of the pattern) up to the first 
"|'', and the last alternative contains everything from the last "|'' to the 
next pattern delimiter. For this reason, it's common practice to include 
alternatives in parentheses, to minimize confusion about where they start and 
end.<br>Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first alternative 
found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that is chosen. This 
means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For example: when matching 
foo|foot against "barefoot'', only the "foo'' part will match, as that is the 
first alternative tried, and it successfully matches the target string. (This 
might not seem important, but it is important when you are capturing matched 
text using parentheses.)<br>Also remember that "|'' is interpreted as a literal 
within square brackets, so if You write [fee|fie|foe] You're really only 
matching [feio|].<br><br><b>Examples:</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>foo(bar|foo)</td>
    <td><i>matchs strings 'foobar' or 'foofoo'.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - subexpressions</h5>The bracketing construct ( ... ) may 
also be used for define r.e. subexpressions (after parsing You can find 
subexpression positions, lengths and actual values in MatchPos, MatchLen and 
Match properties of TRegExpr, and substitute it in template strings by 
TRegExpr.Substitute).<br><br>Subexpressions are numbered based on the left to 
right order of their opening parenthesis.<br>First subexpression has number '1' 
(whole r.e. match has number '0' - You can substitute it in TRegExpr.Substitute 
as '$0' or '$&amp;'). <br><br><b>Examples:</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>(foobar){8,10}</td>
    <td><i>matchs strings which contain 8, 9 or 10 instances of the 
      'foobar'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>foob([0-9]|a+)r</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'foob0r', 'foob1r' , 'foobar', 'foobaar', 'foobaar' 
    etc.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h5>Metacharacters - backreferences</h5><b>Metacharacters</b> \1 through \9 are 
interpreted as backreferences. \&lt;n&gt; matches previously matched 
subexpression #&lt;n&gt;. <br><br><b>Examples:</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>(.)\1+</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'aaaa' and 'cc'.</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(.+)\1+</td>
    <td><i>also match 'abab' and '123123'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(['"]?)(\d+)\1</td>
    <td><i>matchs '"13" (in double quotes), or '4' (in single quotes) or 77 
      (without quotes) etc</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h5>Modifiers</h5>Modifiers are for changing behaviour of TRegExpr.<br><br>There 
are many ways to set up modifiers. <br>Any of these modifiers may be embedded 
within the regular expression itself using the (?...) construct.<br>Also, you 
can assign to appropriate TRegExpr properties (Modifier for example to change 
/x, or ModifierStr to change all modifiers together). The default values for new 
instances of TRegExpr object defined in global variables, for example global 
variable RegExprModifierX defines value of new TRegExpr instance ModifierX 
property. <br><br>

      RegExprModifierR.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The modifier /x itself needs a 
little more explanation. It tells the TRegExpr to ignore whitespace that is 
neither backslashed nor within a character class. You can use this to break up 
your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts. The # character is 
also treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment, for example:<br><br><pre>(
(abc) # comment 1
  |   # You can use spaces to format r.e. - TRegExpr ignores it
(efg) # comment 2
)
</pre>This also means that if you want real whitespace or # characters in the 
pattern (outside a character class, where they are unaffected by /x), that 
you'll either have to escape them or encode them using octal or hex escapes. 
Taken together, these features go a long way towards making regular expressions 
text more readable. <br>
<h5>Perl extensions</h5>(?imsxr-imsxr)<br>You may use it into r.e. for modifying 
modifiers by the fly. If this construction inlined into subexpression, then it 
effects only into this subexpression.<br><br><b>Examples:</b> 
<table>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>(?i)Saint-Petersburg</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'Saint-Petersburg'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(?i)Saint-(?-i)Petersburg</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'Saint-Petersburg' but not 'Saint-petersburg'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(?i)(Saint-)?Petersburg</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'saint-petersburg'</i></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>((?i)Saint-)?Petersburg</td>
    <td><i>matchs 'saint-Petersburg', but not 'saint-petersburg' 
  </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br>(?#text) A comment, the text is ignored. Note 
that TRegExpr closes the comment as soon as it sees a ")", so there is no way to 
put a literal ")" in the comment. <br><br><br><a name="5.6"></a>
<h3>5.6 Add FPS from AVI</h3>Useful if you have a movie and it's corresponding 
subtitle (which is a frame based one) and you want to edit it but you don't know 
the FPS of the movie. If this is your case then use this feature. It lets you 
find out the FPS of a movie file and add it to Subtitle Workshop's list. 
<br>There are two ways in which you can use this feature: 
<ol>
  <li>Using the <b>"Tools/Add FPS from AVI"</b> menu. This method reads the 
  header of the video file, and thus it only works with AVI files (not MPEG, 
  ASF, WMV, etc). It is very fast and if the file is a valid AVI file, it works 
  very well. 
  </li><li>Loading the movie from the <b>"Movie/Open"</b> menu. This method uses 
  DirectX, and so it will work with all kind of video files. There are some 
  cases with AVI files that DirectX detects 0 as FPS, in this cases, Subtitle 
  Workshop will alternatively read the header of the AVI. </li></ol>Each time you 
use this feature, the FPS of the video will be added to all the places in which 
there are boxes to select FPS. <br><br><a name="5.7"></a>
<h3>5.7 External preview</h3>This option makes possible to directly test the 
subtitle file you are working with in your favourite movie player. The movie 
player you use must support <b>command line</b>, and a minimum of one of the 
subtitle formats that Subtitle Workshop supports.<br><br>In the Settings window, 
go to External preview and then to General. Here you must select the exe file of 
the video player you want to use. If the video player is already associated with 
.AVI files, click "Detect associated program" button.<br>Then select if you want 
to be asked for a different video each time you test the subtitle, or if you are 
always going to test the subtitle with the same video.<br><br>In the Advanced 
section, we have other necessary things we have to configure. Select the format 
in which you want the temporary subtitle file to be saved (it will be saved in 
the temp directory). Only select Original format if you are sure that the video 
player you are using supports the subtitle format that you are 
creating/editing.<br><br>Finally, you must select the parameters to send to the 
video player. VIDEO_FILE represents the video file, and SUBT_FILE represents the 
subtitle file. You may add other parameters, like full screen, etc. Please be 
sure (in most cases) to add SUBT_FILE and VIDEO_FILE between " " so if one of 
the files contains one (or more) spaces, it will be sent on the same 
parameter.<br><br>When you finished configuring all this settings, you can test 
the subtitle pressing the <b>F8</b> key or the <b>"Tools/External preview"</b> 
menu.<br><br><br>Tested video players: 
<ol>
  <li><b>BSPlayer</b><br>"VIDEO_FILE" "SUBT_FILE" -fs<br>(Save temp. file in 
  SubRip format) 
  </li><li><b>ViPlay</b><br>/MOVIE:"VIDEO_FILE" /SUBTITLE:"SUBT_FILE" /FS<br>(Save 
  temp. file in any format) </li></ol><br><a name="5.8"></a>
<h3>5.8 Internal Preview: The video engine</h3>
<h4>The Video Preview window: have a look at how your subtitles will 
perform</h4><br>This mode will only works (and makes sense) when you have opened 
a subtitle file and a video file (see <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.1">Loading 
a subtitle file</a> and <a href="Manual.htm#1.4.2">Loading 
a video file</a>). If you have done both, a media player interface will be 
inserted into the upper part of the main editor window. The size of it can be 
adjusted by clicking the mouse on the border of the video and subtitle part of 
the window (a new cursor symbol will show up) and dragging up or down . 
Adjusting the video window will also resize the video itself 
.<br><br><b>Note</b>: If you have an automatic subtitle display filter such as 
VobSub installed, it will of course also be effective in here. This may result 
in two subtitles being displayed on top of each other, at the same time. In that 
case, rename the subtitle file opened unwillingly, or uninstall the 
filter.<br><br>The video window is composed of the displayed video itself, a 
scroll bar, a set of buttons and a set of figures giving current play time, 
total play time and frames per second (FPS) of the video. The subtitle file 
opened will be displayed on top of the video, following it's timing. Font, 
color, size and other attributes can be adjusted in Settings.<br><br>Buttons 
(from left to right): 
<ul>
  <li><b>Play/Pause</b><br>Click once to play, and again to pause. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Stop</b><br>Stops playback and rewinds to 00:00:00.000. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Toggle scroll list</b><br>If in use (will be set in a darkened square), 
  Subtitle Workshop marks the subtitle item being currently displayed in the 
  video in the editor window, and scroll down if necessary. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Jump to previous/next subtitle</b><br>This two buttons just move the 
  player's position to the initial time of the previous/next subtitle of the one 
  currently being displayed. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Rewind &amp; Forward</b><br>If pushed once, they will rewind or forward 
  the amount of time specified in Settings. Preset is 0.5 seconds (500 
  milliseconds).<br>If pushed continuously, they will scroll through the video 
  at rather fast pace. Both ways can be used if the video is playing, paused or 
  stopped. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Alter playback rate</b><br>If pressed (will be set in a dark square), 
  video playback will be slower/faster by the percentage specified in 
  Settings.<br>Preset is 50%. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Move subtitle</b><br>This button moves all the selected subtitles, so 
  that the first one's start time is equal to the player's time. It doesn't 
  modify the duration of the subtitles, just acts like a "quick" version of "Set 
  delay". <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Set Start Time &amp; Set Final Time</b><br>When used, both buttons will 
  affect the subtitle item currently selected in the editor window.<br>"Set 
  start time" will overwrite the start time value of this subtitle to the time 
  the video is currently on, and "Set final time" will do just this for the 
  final time, and jump to the next subtitle. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Start Subtitle &amp; End Subtitle</b><br>"Start subtitle" sets an 
  internal variable to the time in which the movie is playing at that moment, 
  "End subtitle" creates a new subtitle with Initial time equal to that variable 
  and final time equal to the current time. Very useful for creating subtitles 
  from scratch. <br><br>
  </li><li><b>Mark as first synch point, Mark as last synch point, and Add 
  subtitle/vide synchronization point</b><br>This buttons are explained in <a href="Manual.htm#2.3">Adjust 
  subtitles</a>. <br><br></li></ul>The seek bar can be used like the one in 
Windows Media Player, ViPlay or any other player. The smallest possible seeking 
interval depends on the length of the video file. <br><br><br><a name="5.9"></a>
<h3>5.9 SAMI Language Extractor</h3>This feature is intended to extract one or 
more languages from subtitles in SAMI format that contain more than one 
language. Subtitle Workshop doesn't support multilingual SAMIs so with this tool 
you can extract the desired languages and open them as one language SAMIs.
